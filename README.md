# Own-Face-Recogniser

The following Project uses Open CV , along with Machine Learning (SVM) and Haar Cascade frontal face classifier to perform real time face detection.The Faces are captured initially using Open CV and then the SVM model is trained using these images. After this the model performs real time face detection
